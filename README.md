# Yoga Class Admission Form

Welcome to the Yoga Class Admission Form project! This is a simple web application where people can sign up for monthly yoga classes. The project consists of a user-friendly form (front-end) built with React and a server (back-end) developed with Node.js.

## Features

- **User Enrollment:** Individuals can enroll by providing their name, age, and selecting a preferred class time.
- **Basic Validation:** The form ensures participants are aged between 18 and 65.
- **Flexible Batches:** Users can choose different class times each month.
- **Payment Simulation:** The system simulates the payment process for the monthly fees.

## Project Structure
